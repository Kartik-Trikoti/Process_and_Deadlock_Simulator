# Process and Deadlock Simulator
This is an simple Project that ask you for the process information (PID, Burst time, Arrival time, Priority and the Resource that it requires) then you select the scheduling algorithm and based  on that it schedules the process and in between if there is an deadlock it resolves that deadlock by terminating one of the process involved in deadlock
The termination of the process is defined by the condition defined in the deadlock resolver for that particular scheduling algorithim
