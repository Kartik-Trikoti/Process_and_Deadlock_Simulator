# Process and Deadlock Simulator

This project is a simple yet effective simulator for process scheduling and deadlock handling. It allows users to input key details for each process—such as **Process ID (PID), Burst Time, Arrival Time, Priority, and Required Resources**.

Once the input is provided, you can choose a scheduling algorithm (e.g., **FCFS, SJF, Priority, or Round Robin**). The simulator will then:

- ✅ **Schedule** the processes based on the selected algorithm  
- ⚠️ **Detect** any deadlocks that may occur during execution  
- 🛠️ **Resolve** deadlocks by terminating one of the involved processes

Each scheduling algorithm has its own custom deadlock resolution logic, which decides which process to terminate based on conditions such as burst time, arrival time, or priority.
